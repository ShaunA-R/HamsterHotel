I've gone over your codes and it seems like it could work, the classes are there so does the alignment in your divs. Maybe plug in the right classes and double check because it's case sensitive. I know you get the idea on how to rebuild this project, maybe go over it again and ask our teachers for help. Otherwise, Good job on the effort.
